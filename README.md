## Compfest Software Engineering Task

 

Tryin my best but this badboy still looks like a frickin static native html with no css.  Trust me it was built exactly with next-js + react bootsrap and fetching the API from graphql (though it was already there at th boilerplate, but, yea. ).


## Getting Started

_Prerequisites_
There is literally no prerequisites just clone this repo and run this code to your bash: 
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
No need to rename the env.local cause I remove it from '.gitignore'. Vercel env variables sucks so I outsmart with my own way due to the deadline.





### Figma Link
here is the web should be looks like

and for the comparison, I present to you my 'static look' next-js deployed with vercel with my literal 48hr in pain starring my pc trying to gain knowledge exponentially from my zero _react-graphql-vercel brain_  to fulfill the task.
